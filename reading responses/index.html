  <p> I liked when Schwulst talked about web as a plant. So I began thinking about how taking care of plants takes a lot of dedication, time, and attention. That made me think of babies, which made me think of Tamagotchis, which led me to land on this idea of a website that is like a plant Tamagotchi. You would have to come back everyday to "take care of it" and it would grow into a plant within a matter of a week or so...maybe longer. </p>

    <p> The part to "Hello World" that stood out to me was when Choi talked about how the world isn't binary. They mentioned how the world isn't dark and then bright, it has states in between. So I made a website that will just act as a abstract clock sky where the background will changed color throughout the day depending on the time/location. The globe in the middle would spin and be draggable. I know you could just look out the window but I thought it would be cool anyways, could be used like a screensaver idea. </p>
