          <!-- <p> This poster was made as a part of a "Posters Only" class, where we had commisions from a variety of artist and events. The AFO Student Social was a zoom meeting event where students in the foundation courses could talk to seniors in the major before making their decisions. The idea for the poster was to show off skills one will learn while studying within the major. Playing around with composition, color,typography to show off some of the basics and throwing in a bit of animation to show that there's more to the major than just still images</p>
