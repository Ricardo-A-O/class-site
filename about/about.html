  <p> hiii </p>
  <p> i'm a senior vcuarts student majoring in graphic design. </p>
    <p> i don't really know what to write about myself yet... after years of classes :| so i'll just write random things in. i was thinking about maybe writing something diffent into here everyday...like a diary maybe? i could write what i've been up to throughout the days, but that might just end up being me complaining about homework... </p>
    <p>for now i'll keep it about what i like.</p>
    <p> Honestly for as much as i like design i don't really spend a whole lot of my free time on it. since we already have homework to do i kinda like having my free time for other stuff. i will mess around in photoshop occasionally to mess around tho. for the most part i play games and "skate" (it's just me trying to ollie...failing...and then falling just trying to ride normally). </p>
    <p> i hop around from playing differnt games every so often, but there are a few i play consistently. recently i been playing a lot of ghost recon...it's kind of boring but my friends play it so that keeps it entertaining. and my friends got me to play minecraft again. honestly it's relaxing...head empty...just build. and every so often when i feel like suffering i'll play league of legends...fuck that game...i love it. oh and i play a bit of valorant too</p>
    <p> and my alltime favorite game...legend of zelda...masterpiece. </p>
    <p> i love reggaeton, which maybe isn't suprising. listening to it reminds me of puerto rico and it helps with homesickness. bad bunny is king right now, cabron es el mas duro de ahora, but for my alltime faves; don omar, daddy yankee, tego, myke towers, bad bunny aaaaaand maybe jbalvin...maybe. </p>
    <p> i'll throw my instagrams on here too.</p>
    <p> oh and it's pronounced 'kah-sea-keh', a lot of people have trouble with it.</p>
